# Obstacle avoidance

This repository will include obstacle avoidance using CNN and decision-making process. 

- **\cnn_from_article\model.py** includes implemented CNN model from article "A Deep-Network Solution Towards Model-less Obstacle Avoidance" by Lei Tai, Shaohua Li, Ming Liu,
- **\cnn_from_article\dataset** includes dataset of depth images, which I used to train network (from [link](https://ram-lab.com/file/iros_2016.tar.gz)),
- **\cnn_from_article\model_description_to_txt.py** includes saving model and training parameters to txt file,
- **\cnn_from_article\predictions_plot.py** includes functions plotting 20 example random test images with correctness of prediction,
- **\cnn_from_article\train_visualisation.py** includes functions plotting loss and accuracy during training epochs
