# Obstacle avoidance

This repository will include obstacle avoidance using CNN and decision-making process.


- **\cnn_from_article\model.py** includes implemented CNN model from article "A Deep-Network Solution Towards Model-less Obstacle Avoidance" by Lei Tai, Shaohua Li, Ming Liu. Dataset is available to download from [link](https://ram-lab.com/file/iros_2016.tar.gz)),
- **\cnn_from_article\nn_register.py** includes simple functions to save and visualise neural network model.
- **\cnn_from_article\training** is a folder with learned CNN (the best is train_v7 so far).
